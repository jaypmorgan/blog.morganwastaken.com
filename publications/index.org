    <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have often supplied state-of-the-art results in pattern recognition tasks. Despite their advances, however, the existence of adversarial examples have caught the attention of the community. Many existing works have proposed methods for searching for adversarial examples within fixed-sized regions around training points. Our work complements and improves these existing approaches by adapting the size of these regions based on the problem complexity and data sampling density. This makes such approaches more appropriate for other types of data and may further improve adversarial training methods by increasing the region sizes without creating incorrect labels.</p>

    <h2>Jay Morgan, Adeline Paiement, Monika Seisenberger, Jane Williams, Adam Wyner</h2>
    <p>This paper presents a novel method to address legal rights for children through a chatbot framework by integrating machine learning, a dialogue graph, and information extraction. The method addresses a significant problem: we cannot presume that children have common knowledge about their rights or express themselves as an adult might. In our framework, a chatbot user begins a conversation, where based on the circumstance described, a neural network predicts both speech acts, relating to a dialogue graph, and legal types. Information is extracted in order to create a case for a legal advisor. In collaboration with the Children's Legal Centre Wales, who advocate for the improvement of legal rights in Wales, a corpus has been constructed and a prototype chatbot developed. The framework has been evaluated with classification measures and a user study.</p>
