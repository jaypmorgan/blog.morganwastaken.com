We'll be presenting a poster at the [[https://mosaiics.astro.bas.bg/?page_id=165][Machine Learning and Computer
Vision in Heliophysics international workshop]], Sofia, Bulgaria.

The poster concerns the our work on improving the down-stream feature
detection of solar features by removing the contanimation of clouds
from ground-based observations. We've started to open-source our
[[https://github.com/jaypmorgan/cloud-removal][program code on github]], but please come and ask some questions if
you're at the conference!
