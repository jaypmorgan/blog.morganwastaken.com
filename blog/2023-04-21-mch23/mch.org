The [[https://mosaiics.astro.bas.bg/?page_id=165][2023 Machine Learning and Computer Vision in Heliophysics]]
conference, hosted in the luxurious Millennium hotel, Sofia, Bulgaria,
has now concluded after 3 days of interesting and thought-provoking
lectures.

Following this conference, I wanted to highlight some of the talks, as
well as drawing and picking up common threads that were interwoven
through all the presentations. From this, I hope to better understand
what the current research is, more than one would gain for looking at
each work in its isolation.

If you were at this conference and you think that I've missed
something that should be covered in this discussion, please do get in
touch and let me know!

* Simple models are useful models

Much of the work showed thoughtful feature extraction, coupled with
domain knowledge, and selection of traditional machine learning models
can still produce reliable models upon which to make
predictions. Take, for example, [[https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00132801][Hanne Baeke]]'s talk where active
regions are classified using the magnetic properties. A small number
of features were selected by evaluating the usefulness and duplication
of information present in all the features. After a sparse autoencoder
was used to encode a slightly larger representation, that was
classified using a $k$ -NN model in a supervised way, and $k$ -means
in a unsupervised way.

But while, we have seen such use of traditional machine learning, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) also make their appearance. I noticed a use of
common models through applications. In particular, we saw many
applications using either U-Net or YOLO.

[[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea-Diercke][Andrea Diercke]] created a labelled (the labels being bounding-boxes)
dataset of filaments in the H-\alpha wavelength. These labels were
used to train a YOLO model to recognise the presence of filaments so
other, more computationally expensive algorithms but potentially more
accurate, could be used to create segmentation masks on smaller
regions of the images.

* More data is better data

Heliophyics is no exception in the world where more data is needed to
adequately train ML models. Despite many satellites, telescopes, and
other sensoring equipment constantly gathering data, a very large
percentage of the data being recorded contains nothing
interesting. For example, take [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/alin-razvan-paraschiv/][Alin Razvan Paraschiv]]'s talk in which
they would like to classify whether, based on a small number of
features, a cosmic mass ejection (CME) will interact with the Earth
(geoeffective). In this talk, 99.3% of all data is
non-geoeffective. Class-imbalance is then a persistent problem. The
disruptive events we want to detect and predict happen very rarely. In
[[https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-mercea-a13091105][Vanessa Mercea]]'s talk on the detection of sunquakes, these type of
events only happen around 2 times per year. Given then length of time
since they've been discovered, we haven't observed a whole lot of
them.

To combat the issue of small samples of positive data, the [[https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302][Synthetic
Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)]] algorithm was very often
used to generate synthetic examples.

Other cases used a DNN to generate data. Take, for example, [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-pio-ramunno-a03a20158/?originalSubdomain=it][Francesco
Pio Ramunno]] demonstrating a very interesting method of generating
solar disk images that contain desired solar features using a
Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Others like [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-esteban-agudelo-ortiz-5a34741b5?originalSubdomain=co][Juan Esteban Agudelo
Ortiz]] used a GAN architecture to generate stokes parameters.

As the events we're interested in happen very infrequently, but we're
recording all of the time, we are essentially wasting our storage with
useless data. [[https://homepages.dias.ie/murphp30/][Pearse Murphy]] used a U-Net trained to segment type-II and
type-III solar bursts so that data could be automatically binned and
we reduce the storage costs by restricting the saving data closer to
solar events.

Instead of generating data, DNNs were used to clean existing data. For
example [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremiah-Scully][Jeremiah Scully]] 's work in cleaning of radio frequency
interference using GANs. Or, [[https://adelinepaiement.github.io/][Adeline Paiement]] presenting [[https://github.com/jaypmorgan/cloud-removal][our work]] on
the cleaning of cloud contaminants from H-\alpha and Ca-II imaging. We
used a U-Net model in a C-GAN architecture to learn the cloud
transmittance. The transmittance values could then be added to the
solar disk, resulting in a cleaned image. You can find out [[https://github.com/jaypmorgan/presentations/tree/main/2023-04-19-Cloud-removal][poster at

* Other talks

Not all of the talks fit into my classification here. But I wanted to
highlight some other interesting talks that do not follow the trend
placed above, though this in itself is not an exhaustive list.

#+caption: [[https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=fzGHAccAAAAJ&hl=en][Manuel Luna]] presenting his work on the characterisation on the oscillisation of filaments.

[[file:images/20230419_102413.jpg]]

First we have [[https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=fzGHAccAAAAJ&hl=en][Manuel Luna]]'s work of detecting the oscillation of
filament structures and its characterisation over a 6-month
period. Secondlly, we have Benoit's talk of creating a 3d-simulation
of the sun by predicting the image of the solar disk from angles where
there are no satellites. Other works include [[https://www.bu.edu/astronomy/profile/connor-obrien/][Connor O'Brien's]] lecture
on the probabilisitc determination of solar wind propagation using an
RNN model.
